General

    RESTful web service: a web service that adheres to the design principles of the REST architecture
        "Representational State Transfer"

Java

    Annotation: Text that provides extra info to the compiler about the code
                Used one live above class or code declarations
                "@ThisIsAnAnnotation"

    "public class Example {}": The name of the class, 'Example', has to be the same as that of the file

    "public record Example {}": A 'record' is a type of final class that is an immutable data carrier
        Why choose it over class? Reduces the boilerplate code needed for initialisation

    "public static void main(String[] args) {}": Java looks for this line as the entry point for any app

Spring Boot

    Selling point of the framework is that it speeds up setup and deployment of apps
        It contains an embedded server and makes a single executable jar file (can be run immediately)
    
    The key components of Spring Boot seem to be:
        Dependencies
            Are included in the properties of each application and reduce the work needed to integrate functions
            For example, Spring Boot has REST and Frontend dependencies available for easy integration

        Annotations
            Define or tag code to perform additional functions at runtime

            Controllers
                Classes that handle HTTP requests and return a response (POST, GET)

            Beans
                Are Java objects that are managed by Spring instead of themselves
                For example, 

    An example of a Spring Boot application is a RESTful web service
        - Web page that displays a JSONObject containing an 'id' and a 'string'
        - The string is able to take a parameter from the URL and override its default value
            For example, a string with "Hello, {name}!" takes a name value from the "?name=Isaac" portion of the URL
        - The 'id' counts the number of times a new object is made (whenever the name parameter is changed)
        - HTTP requests (POST, GET, etc.) are handled by a controller class

    The Spring initialiser is a website that generates a starter codebase for applications
        Speeds up development as the boilerplate code is already written
        
    Spring Boot accesses object properties through a specific naming convention for getter and setter methods
        The first letter and ONLY the first letter of a get and set method (getName/ setName) must be capitalised

Spring Boot Workflow

    A Controller class is required for each webpage that is displayed
        The GetMapping annotation is used to specify the URL of the page (i.e. "/hello")
